I couldn 't use docker because, the termui library i'm using is buggy in docker, and I found out why :
https://github.com/gizak/termui/issues/116


Run the program :
- go build && ./http-monitoring
- I'm using https://github.com/kiritbasu/Fake-Apache-Log-Generator to generate the log lines


Details :
- You can change on the main file, the path of the access.log (defaults to "/var/log/access.log")
- The ParseLine function of the logParser file reads a commonLog file, reads each lines, then send it to a channel.
- The Monitoring function of the monitoring file receives these lines, send them to the UI, and convert
  all the data inside these lines to a logLine structure.
- The MonitoringData structure contains all the data used for the monitoring (total number of http requests,
  total http size ...)
- In the Monitoring function, every X seconds we will send the MonitoringData structure to the UI,
  but we will also check every X' seconds that the HTTP threshold has not been crossed.
- In the UI file, the EventLoop function will loop infinitely and wait until one of the previous event is triggered,
  and then display the appropriate info in the console (Refresh of the monitoring number, alerts or recovers)


Possible Improvements :
- Add new alerting logics (alert if too many 404/500 errors...)
- Better organize the code structure, to be able to add new monitoring parameters and make it more scalable
  (I judged it wasn't necessary for the sake of readability of the code because we only have 1 alerting logic)
- Add different log format readers
